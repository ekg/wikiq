wikiq: a WikiMedia XML data dump to .tsv parser

author: Erik Garrison <erik@hypervolu.me>

wikiq is written in C using expat.  It is designed to enable researchers to
rapidly extract revision histories (minus text and comments) from impossibly
large XML datasets.

To use, first make sure you have libexpat installed, then:

    % make
    % ./wikiq -h  # prints usage
    % 7za e -so hugewikidatadump.xml | ./wikiq >hugewikidatadump.tsv
